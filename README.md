[# clean-room](https://room-checker.netlify.app)

This project is a web application which task is to make the life of the reception easier.

The features are:

- checking / check off tasks for a room
- checking all taks for a room
- adding important and specific tasks for the day
- if all tasks of a room are checked, the room gets displayed green on the homepage. If not the room gets displayed red.


When cleaning a room the maid can specify which tasks are finished and what rooms are already cleaned.
Then the reception is always uptodate on the cleaning status of the rooms.

Also the reception can add important tasks that need to be done for the day.

I used React, CSS , HTML for the Frontend.

And the Firebase realtime database to save, manipulate and display the current status of rooms and tasks.
